##Introduction
  Software architecture deals with the design and implementation of the high-level structure of the softwarre. It is the result of assembling a certain number of architectural elements in some well-chosen forms to satisfy the major functionality and performance requirements of the system, as well as some other, non-functional requirements such as reliability, scalability, portability and availability. Software architecture deals with abstraction, decomposition and composition, style and esthetics.

###4+1 Architetural View Model 
  To describe a software architecture, a model composed of multiple views or perspetives, known as ***4+1 View Model*** has been developed. The ***4+1 Architetural View Model*** is an *architecture style* to organize an application's architecture representation into views to meet individual stakeholder's needs. The four views of the model are logical, development, process and deployment view. In addition selected use cases or scenarios are used to illustrate the architecture serving as the ***plus one*** view.  
  The following figure shows how this model is structured:

  </p>
  
* ***Logical view***: concerned with the functionality that the system provides to end-users; 
* ***Development view***: illustrates a system from a programmer's perspective and is concerned with software management;
* ***Deployment view***: depicts the system from a system engineer's point of view. It is concerned with the topology of software components on the physical layer as well as the physical connections between these components
* ***Process view***: deals with the dynamic aspects of the system, explains the system processes and how they communicate, and focuses on the runtime behavior of the system

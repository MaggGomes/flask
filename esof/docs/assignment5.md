##Identification of feature
   
After some discussion beetween the members of the group we decide to the feature [#1286](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/1286), because we think it is very important and why is that? Because uftp8 it is becoming to be more used than non-ASCII code and since we believe that is very important to have flask updated to be more compatible with what the clients want or need, we decide to implement this feature.

##Introduction

In software engineering, Software Maintance or Evolution is the process of improve and optimize the software. This phase happens when the software is already in use. Normally this step is taken to fix errors and implement new features required by users or the community.

The maintance of the software usually have costs, but since flask is an open source there are no costs.

Since flask is an open source project, there are multiple features that normaly are proposed by the community. This report has the purpose to show all the process to implent a new feature, since the identification of the feature until the pull request to the main project.

##Identification of feature
   
After some discussion beetween the members of the group we decide to the feature [#1286](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/1286), because we think it is very important and why is that? Uftp8 is becoming to be more used than non-ASCII code and since we believe that is very important to have flask updated to be more compatible with what the clients want or need, we decide to implement this feature.
